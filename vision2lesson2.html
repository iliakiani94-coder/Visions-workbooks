The modern lifestyle has had both positive and negative effects on people's lives. Modern technologies have enabled us to have easy access to information, become more creative, experience fast communication, travel easier, and have a more comfortable life. Have you ever imagined a world without the Internet, tablets, mobile phones, airplanes, and vacuum cleaners? Most people cannot do that, as technology is the miracle of our time. 

But using new technologies has changed people's lifestyle in a harmful way in this century as well. Some technologies are dangerous to our health and can harm our body. Using mobile phones or surfing the Internet for long hours can increase people's blood pressure and cause sleep problems. Playing video games for long hours makes people nervous and harm their heart and nervous system. Listening to music by headsets can be harmful to one's hearing and even brain.

Using technology in a wrong way has created bad habits and new types of addictions. It is not strange now to call someone an Internet or mobile addict. Technology addicts are people with serious problems to control themselves to use various kinds of technology, in particular the Internet, smartphones, tablets and laptops. Technology addicts do not like to socialize with people; instead, they prefer to be alone and spend lots of their time working with their devices. This makes them depressed and impatient. 

Specialists have found different ways to cure technology addicts. To avoid this type of addiction, people should spend more time with their friends and family members, do daily exercise, and limit the time of working with technologies. They also need to enjoy nature more and have regular plans to travel
