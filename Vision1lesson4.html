    <h1>How to be a good traveler</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Travel is about visiting new places and meeting new people. When visiting a destination, a traveler should take care of people, places and cultures. So, before any travel, we must pay attention to some points.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, we must read as much as possible about the main tourist attractions we are going to visit. Searching the Internet is an easy way to know about them. Also, learning a few words and phrases of the local language can be very useful, especially when we meet new people there. When we meet local people, we must not forget that we are guests!
        </p>

        <p>
            So, we must respect their way of living. When visiting historical and especially holy places, we must respect them, too. When we visit natural places such as lakes, forests and deserts, we must protect the plants and wild animals. In this way, every travel can be a great experience for us.
