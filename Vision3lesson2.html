  <h1>Using a Dictionary</h1>

  <p>
A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words and expressions. You can find words easily because dictionaries put them in alphabetical order. The word ‘dictionary’ comes from the Latin ‘dictio’ (‘saying’).
There are several types of dictionaries. Dictionaries which explain words and how they are used; dictionaries which translate words from one language to another; dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people; and technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words. 
Dictionaries which explain what words mean give a clear ‘definition’ of them. A good dictionary also gives more information about words. For instance, it explains how they are pronounced. Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used for this purpose. There are also dictionaries which translate words into other languages. Very often one volume translates both ways; for example, half of the book is from English to Persian and the other half from Persian to English.
When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language, one has to be careful to choose the right meaning.
A word like ‘right’ has several meanings in English, for example, ‘correct’ and ‘the opposite of left’. A word like ‘present’ may be used as an adjective, meaning ‘not absent’, as a noun, meaning ‘gift’ or as a verb, meaning ‘give’. Words with different meanings exist in other languages, too. A good dictionary lists all the meanings of words to 
help people find the meaning that they look for.
A complete dictionary also tells you about the origin of words and the story behind them. For example, the words like ‘pajamas’, ‘bazaar’ and ‘paradise’ entered English from Persian.
