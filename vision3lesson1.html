  <h1>Cultures and Lifestyles</h1>

  <p>
It is very important for us to respect our elders. It is also important to note that elders were not born elders; they were kids like us and now have grown old. A few years hence we will also grow older. If today we respect them, our present and future generations will carry those values and will learn to respect us as well when we grow old.
Elders have a lot to share with us: their life experiences, their failures, their successes and many more. Thus we need to care for them because they deserve to be cared for. Respect and care for elders start with our parents as they are our first teachers in our life.
No matter what we do in our lives, who we are, and where we live, we must love them as they love us unconditionally. They feel honored when we appreciate their love and respect them. So it is our duty to help them when they need us because they are not young enough to handle things on their own like before.
