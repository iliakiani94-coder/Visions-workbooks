    <h1>Who is a Scientist?</h1>

    <p>
      The world around us is full of amazing things. Knowing this beautiful world
      is very interesting for humans. One group of people who study the world are
      scientists. A scientist studies nature, animals, or people. Scientists work
      hard and do research to solve problems, find facts, or invent new things.
      Scientists learn about the world by observing and experimenting.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are different types of scientists. Some of them study plants, earth,
      seas, or animals. Others study people and how they behave and learn. Some
      scientists like to study history or languages. Others are interested in
      making new things. They want to make people's lives easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some scientists become very rich and famous. Many people around the world
      may remember their names and faces. But this is not what they call
      “success”. They feel successful when they solve problems and find answers
      to their questions.
