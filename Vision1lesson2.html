    <h1>Microbes</h1>

    <p>
      Microbes are really wonderful. They are everywhere! They live all around you,
      on you, and inside you! Microbes are very small, so you can’t see them.
      But don’t worry. Some microbes make you sick, but most others keep you healthy
      and even help you fight disease.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are so many different types of microbes. We still don’t really know
      how many there are, but we know that microbes do lots of different things.
      Bacteria and viruses are two important types of microbes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bacteria are really important microbes. They are very small and have only
      one cell. Bacteria can live in any area of the earth. They aren’t all bad;
      in fact, you couldn’t live without some bacteria!
    </p>

    <p>
      Viruses are among the smallest microbes on the earth, even smaller than bacteria.
      They are different from bacteria because they cannot live on their own.
      Viruses need to be inside a living cell to live and grow. There aren’t many
      good things about viruses – they usually attack your body and make you sick!
