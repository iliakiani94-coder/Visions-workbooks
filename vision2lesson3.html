  <h1>Cultures and Lifestyles</h1>

  <p>
Culture is a system of shared beliefs that are common in a society. Often, we think of the food, music, clothing, and holidays that are common in a society as its culture, but these are only some of the elements. Other elements include customs, values, behaviors, and artifacts. Culture is, therefore, a combination of thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. 

With more than 190 countries and 7 billion people on earth, it is not hard to imagine that many cultures exist. No matter where you go around the world, you will face people, lifestyles and cultures that are different to what you have. People around the world have very different lives and ways of living . They have different beliefs and customs. So they usually live and behave according to what they believe to be right and wrong.
Learning to respect other cultures is important for having new experiences and learning about the world. One of the first steps to learn about other cultures is to simply accept that there are many different cultures exist other than our own culture. One of the most important ways to learn to become respectful of other cultures is to spend some time reflecting on our own. Then it is important to understand something about other cultures. 
For those who want to learn about other cultures, but do not know where to start, a great place to start is reading about the cultures that interest them. In today’s world if we all are able to know about other cultures, and respect them, life would be easier for most of us.
