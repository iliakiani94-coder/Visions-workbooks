  <h1>Electric Cars</h1>

  <p>
Many countries now think that cars that burn fossil fuels should be replaced by electric cars. Electric cars don’t burn gasoline in the engine, so they don’t pollute the air. They use electricity stored on the car in batteries. 
Sometimes, 12 or 24 batteries, or more, are needed to power the car. Just like a remote-controlled car, an electric car has an electric motor that turns the wheels and a battery to run the motor. Electricity, the same energy that lights your lamps and runs your TV, is stored in batteries on an electric car. The batteries can be like the batteries you find in flashlights or in regular gasoline cars.
To get the battery ready to roll, you have to charge it. This process isn’t much different from the way you charge the portable devices you carry around every day: your cell phone, MP3 player, or digital camera. The difference is that you deal with a much bigger gadget that carries you around instead.
The electric car is usually plugged in at night. The car can be plugged into a special charging unit even at houses. Some electric cars can be plugged right into a regular electrical wall outlet. Others need a larger outlet, like the kind that a stove or a vacuum cleaner plugs into.
The engineers are trying to make better batteries that hold more energy and last longer. To overcome the problem of charging electric cars, hybrid cars are also available. Hybrid cars combine the benefits of gasoline engines and electric motors. They can be designed to meet different goals, such as better fuel economy or more power.
